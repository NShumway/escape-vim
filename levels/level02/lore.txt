"You survived the training course.
 Good. But that was just a warm-up.

 This maze... it's different. The walls
 twist and turn. Dead ends everywhere.
 One wrong move and you'll be walking
 in circles for hours.

 I've seen soldiers with years of
 experience get lost in these corridors.
 They forget the basics. Start second-
 guessing every keystroke.

 Stay calm. Trust your movements.
 h, j, k, l — they haven't failed
 you yet.

 Find the exit. Prove you're ready
 for what comes next."

                    — The Commander
