"You made it through the maze. Good.
 But now the real test begins.

 See those shadows moving in the
 corridors? Those are the Watchers.
 They patrol these halls endlessly,
 and if they spot you... let's just
 say you won't get a second chance.

 Study their patterns. Time your
 movements. The spaces between walls
 are your only cover.

 h, j, k, l got you this far.
 Now you'll need patience too.

 Reach the exit. Don't get caught."

                    — The Commander
