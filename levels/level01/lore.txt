"Soldier. You've been trapped inside
 the VIM editor. Many have entered.
 Few have escaped.

 I've seen recruits freeze at the
 sight of that blinking cursor. Watched
 them mash Escape until their fingers
 went numb. Some are still in there,
 typing :quit over and over, hoping
 something will change.

 But you're different. I can see it.

 Your mission: learn the ancient
 commands that will set you free.
 Move with purpose. Act with precision.
 And whatever you do...

 Don't panic."

                    — The Commander
